Absolutely, let's simplify the exercises to focus on fundamental Python concepts:

1. **Data Types:**
   a. Create variables for an integer, a float, and a string. Print each variable and its data type.
   b. Create a list with three different data types (e.g., integer, string, float). Print the list and its length.
   c. Create a tuple with two elements. Print the tuple and its type.

2. **Control Structures:**
   a. Write a for loop to print numbers from 1 to 5.
   b. Write a while loop to print even numbers from 2 to 6.
   c. Write an if statement to check if a number is greater than 10. Print a message accordingly.

3. **Strings:**
   a. Create a string variable and print its length.
   b. Use string concatenation to combine two strings and print the result.
   c. Use string slicing to print the first three characters of a string.

4. **Lists and Tuples:**
   a. Create a list with three elements. Append a new element to the list and print it.
   b. Create a tuple with two elements. Try to modify one of its elements and observe the error.
   c. Iterate over a list of names and print each name.

5. **Dictionaries:**
   a. Create a dictionary representing a person's information (e.g., name, age, city).
   b. Print the value associated with the "age" key.
   c. Modify the value associated with the "city" key and print the updated dictionary.

6. **Functions:**
   a. Write a function to calculate the sum of two numbers. Call the function with different arguments and print the result.
   b. Write a function to check if a number is even. Print "Even" or "Odd" based on the result.
   c. Write a function that takes a list as input and returns the maximum value in the list.

7. **Recursion:**
   a. Write a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number.
   b. Write a recursive function to calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to n.

8. **File Handling:**
   a. Write a program to read data from a text file and print each line.
   b. Write a program to write a list of numbers to a text file, each number on a separate line.

These exercises are simpler and focused on basic Python concepts to help solidify your understanding.
